# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.

The website composed of flipping cards can be used for survey collection or as a method of gathering information from many participants. By utilizing this digital platform, data may be gathered more easily, and historians or humanists could use it to construct a catalogue of information for their research. Furthermore, this digital method of collection can also benefit those whom are contributing information by providing an anonymous route. For individuals whom are contributing information on sensitive topics, anonymity can make the difference between their decisions to contribute or to not, and crucially, their safety. Although the digital collection of data may pose different problems to the traditional method of information cultivation, it offers distinct benefits in the areas of speed, ease and anonymity. 

## Question 2
### This assignment asks you all to perform a certian amount of work (describing yourselves) in order to improve a project (the course roster website). What responsibilities does the "researcher" (in this case, your teacher) have to the participants (you)? What rights do or should the participants have to the end product? 

A major topic of today’s digital age are the debates over information. What should be done with information that has been collected? Do those whose information has been collected have any rights to it once it has been given? The same framework of questions can be applied to the relationship between the “researcher” and the participants of this assignment. In an ideal scenario, the researcher would not misuse the data that has been collected and provide a clear and upfront agreement of how the information would be used. Provided such a situation, the participants would have the rights to all the information except that which has been agreed to be used by the researcher.  

## Question 3
### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

The “fields” needed to be provided by the student for each record are the values created by the maker of the file, and in this case, those like “firstname”, “lastname”, “academic interests” etc. Therefore, the values are left blank for the students to fill in. The limitation of this sort of data structure is that it cannot catch errors easily, as in our case, a third-party extension – Mocha test – is used to catch errors. Additionally, if it is opened with untrusted browsers, the information may be easily hacked and stolen and there are limited tools compatible with and used to support JSON files.
